# Tailwind CSS Setup Examples

A repository of examples showing how to setup Tailwind in a variety of different frameworks and environments.

Please note that these examples are for the most part contributed and maintained by the community, and we merge them without a ton of review because it seems more helpful to have *something* than nothing. If you notice any issues or inconsistencies across different examples, we welcome all contributions to improve them.

## Available Examples

- [vue-cli](examples/vue-cli)
- [Nuxt.js](examples/nuxt)
- [Svelte](examples/svelte)
- [Sapper](examples/sapper)
- [Laravel](examples/laravel-postcss-only) (PostCSS-only)
- [Gridsome](examples/gridsome)
- [Wordpress](examples/wordpress-laravel-mix) (using Laravel Mix)

## Requested Examples

If you are experienced with any of these frameworks, we'd love a PR that includes a barebones example of the best way to set up Tailwind in that environment.

Please include instructions for the setup process as well, so it's easier for others to follow. [Here's an example](examples/vue-cli/README.md).

If we're missing you're favorite framework, don't hesitate to PR that either!
