# reason-react-boilerplate

## Installing / Getting started

All the dependencies can be install via your favorite package manager:

```shell
yarn install
```

That's it! You're up and running, you can start the project with:

```shell
yarn start
```

## Developing

Assuming you're developing with Visual Studio Code (if you're not, you should definitely give it a shot, it's awesome), all you need to develop is this extension: [vscode-reasonml](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vscode-reasonml).

This will give you compilation errors in the editor and code intelliscence.

## Built With

Here's the list of the frameworks or libraries we use in the project:

- [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/en/) - Fast and quality type safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems.
